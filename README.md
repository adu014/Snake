Snake Game
This repository contains a customizable Snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. Players navigate a snake around the screen to collect food, increasing its length and score while avoiding collisions.

Features
Customizable Gameplay: Users can set the colors of the snake head, body, and food, as well as the points earned per food item.
Real-Time Scoring: The game displays the current score and high score dynamically on the screen.
Smooth Snake Movement: The snake moves fluidly in response to player controls, with its body following the head.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or its own body.
Increasing Difficulty: The game speeds up as the snake eats more food.
How It Works
Game Initialization:

The screen is set up with a black background, 600x600 dimensions, and event listeners for keyboard controls.
Players customize the snake head, body, and food colors, as well as the score increment per food item.
Player Controls:

Use the WASD keys to move the snake:
W: Up
A: Left
S: Down
D: Right
Gameplay Mechanics:

The snake starts as a single square and grows with each food consumed.
Food is repositioned randomly on the screen when eaten.
The snake body segments follow the head as it moves.
Scoring:

The score increases by the user-defined points per food item.
The high score is updated if the current score exceeds it.
Scores are displayed at the top of the screen.
Game Over Conditions:

The game resets if the snake:
Collides with the screen edges.
Collides with its own body.
Dynamic Updates:

The gameplay speed decreases slightly with each food consumed, adding a layer of challenge.
